# Linear-Regression-UCI-Adult-Dataset-
Implemented Linear Regression of the UCI Adult Dataset. 

This code uses a modified version of the Adult Dataset the data is provided as three separate files:
a7a.train : used to train the model
a7a.dev : used to find the optimal lambda
a7a.test : used to test the accuracy of our model

Results:

The dev set gave an accuracy of:
7158  correct predictions for  8461  points.
The accuracy is 0.845999290864 .

The train set gave an accuracy of:
13615  correct predictions for  16100  points.
The accuracy is 0.845652173913 .

The test set gave an accuracy of:
7160  correct predictions for  8461  points.
The accuracy is 0.846235669543 .
